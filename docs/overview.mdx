Every respectable organization that produces software adheres to certain best practices and conventions. These living documents
represent _our_ best practices and conventions that we developed over time from our experience and observations. We welcome
any improvements and suggestions to these documents, so don't be afraid to contribute!

The documents are sorted into three categories:
* [Getting Started](./getting-started/the-first-mile) - Essential information for new developers
* [Collaboration](./collaboration/git-gud.md) - Our conventions and practices
* [Style Guides](./style-guides) - Style guides for different languages (and technical writing)
