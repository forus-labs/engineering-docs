We follow Effective Dart's [style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and 
[documentation style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation). An exception to this is the
characters line limit. Instead of **_80_** characters, we adhere to a **_120_** characters line limit.
