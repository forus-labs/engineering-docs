_A Gentleman's guide to good development etiquette._

This guide contains what we consider to be good development etiquette that gentlemen follow. Only barbarians willfully ignore them.

## Pull Requests

### Draft a Pull Request

A gentleman drafts a pull request when soliciting feedback. Barbarians willfully submit a work-in-progress pull request
as ready for review.

Drafting a pull request distinguishes between pull requests soliciting feedback and those ready for review. It helps other
developers keep track of a pull request's status.

### Perform a Self-review

Before submitting a pull request for peer-review, a gentleman performs a cursory self-review and fixes any obvious mistakes
they can find. Barbarians willfully (mis)uses peer-reviews as a human-powered lint to spot trivial issues. 

It's perfectly normal to submit a pull request with a few careless mistakes. On the contrary, submitting a pull request filled 
with careless mistakes every other line implies that the developer is a barbarian that simply does not care or does not spot
the mistakes. Both of which does not reflect well on the developer.

A pull request filled with careless mistakes dramatically slows down the progress of a code review. Not to mention, it is
a frustrating experience for the reviewer. Put yourself into the shoes of the reviewer and imagine if someone else did the same.
