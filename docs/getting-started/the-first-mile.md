_Essential information for new developers._

Welcome to Forus Labs! The first week is always a whirlwind, but equally exciting. This article summarizes a few pieces of 
essential logistical information for you to kick-start your journey.

## The First Mile

### First Day

An on-boarding buddy will be assigned to you as part of our on-boarding process. On the first day you'll be receiving a
proper introduction to the team and your on-boarding buddy. Make sure you're free for lunch as we will have a welcome lunch with the team.
Subsequently, you'll be spending most of the day reading through our documentation and setting up your development environment.

### First Two Weeks

Most of your first two week will be spent discovering our technologies, process and culture. You will also be spending some
time pair programming with your on-boarding buddy as well as the rest of the team.

## Your Development Environment

### Source Version Control

We use a GitHub organization to manage our codebase. You will need to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
After creating an account, you will need to enable [2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

### Backend Development

Our backend is mostly written in Java. Hence, you will need to install [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/). Most of the team
uses [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). However, some of
us prefer [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) as well.

In addition, we recommend installing either [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/?ref=stackshare) or
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/?ref=stackshare) for working with our PostgreSQL databases.

### Mobile Development

Our mobile applications are mostly written in Dart/Flutter. You will need to follow the OS-dependent instructions listed
[here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install Flutter. Since Dart is bundled with Flutter, you do not need
to install Dart separately. We strongly recommend using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
since it is more feature-rich. However, some of us prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
